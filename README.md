# poor-mans-jasmine
Just some fun I had creating my own little unit-testing framework that vaguely resembles JasmineJS and the 'assert' approach John Resig pioneered with QUnit

`poor-mans-jasmine.js` contains the functionality of this mini testing framework.
`poor-mans-jasmine.css` contains, obviously, the style defintions for the outputs.
`poor-mans-jasmine.html` shows an example of how to pull it all together.
